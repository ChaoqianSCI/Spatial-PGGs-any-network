- everything_r_bc_accu.m - A matlab function. Input population size N and adjacency matrix w_ij. If w_ij(i,j)=1 then i and j are neighbors, and vice versa if w_ij(i,j)=0. The function will then return [r_PC,r_DB,r_BD,r_PC_accu,r_DB_accu,r_BD_accu,bc_PC,bc_DB,bc_BD,bc_PC_accu,bc_DB_accu,bc_BD_accu],
